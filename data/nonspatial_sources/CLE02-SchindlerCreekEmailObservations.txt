Micheal, 

Good eyes!  The Shindler Ck HUC should have been been included in both the historic range and the present distribution. Got away from us, probably cus its such a small system on the steep west side.

As you see from the pictures of the 2012 "hitch"  migration on Chi Council website – I see one blackfish and one bass in addition to hitch – the citizen science observations of the Chi council are not always the most reliable.  Regardless, with multiple observations from different observers over several years it appears that hitch are using this small system if only intermittently.  We will change our maps accordingly.  Let Nick know if you would like assistance changing yours.

best fishes,

JK

> Greetings friends -- some really exciting news: this morning USFS observers saw a school of hitch (estimated at 350 fish) in Middle Creek at Hwy 20: this is the first substantial grouping seen in Middle since 2006, and the first since rock weirs have mitigated the impediment to migration that previously existed at the Rancheria Rd bridge. They also saw a single hitch swimming up the Clover Creek diversion. The big question now: will these fish continue upstream past the weirs?

> Exciting news #2: yesterday Bill Rett & Judy Barnes, who have been keeping very careful tabs on Schindler Creek for as long as the Chi Council has existed without seeing a single hitch in that stream, "spotted hitch in a deep pool (same spot we saw catfish a week or so ago).  We sat there for about 15 minutes and there were at least a half dozen hitch swimming in among roots in a deep pool.  They seemed to be in a kind of holding pattern." Hurray for Bill & Judy -- photo has been posted to website.

> Exciting news #3: large groups of hitch, reported as being very large, have been seen in Kelsey Creek below the detention structure, and a few observed as far upstream as Merritt Road. Pix on website, including one showing substantial lesions that may have resulted from the fish having been knocked around during the very high flows last week.
