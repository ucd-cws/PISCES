The dorsal fin is a bit ratty, but I'm pretty sure it is a tidewater goby.
What made it noteworthy was that it was 56mm total length -- I think this is the largest I have ever seen.
(Inland Fishes of California states that specimens over 50mm are rare...)
Besides the fin, it was in good condition.
(Many larger specimens close to 50mm I find often are emaciated, like their senescence is taking its toll…)

Subject: Pismo Lagoon Seining Results - May 29, 2013 (TE 101154-1 Tidewater Goby)
 
Stephanie, Ryan;
Thanks for your help during our "3 hour tour" of Pismo Lagoon and the Carpenter Creek pools last week.  Here is a run-down of our catch, please let me know if you have anything to add.

In summary, we saw 4* species of fish in Pismo Lagoon as we seined from the mouth upstream to the first bridge: tidewater goby, staghorn sculpin, threespine stickleback, and prickly sculpin.  The latter (66mm TL) was only in our catch on the southwest side of the bridge -- our upstream-most haul.  We also made one haul in the western end of the Carpenter Creek pool -- tidewater goby was the only species seen there (hundreds in the net, up to 48mm TL).
* Plus we caught and removed 3 mature bluegill…

The Carpenter Creek water was not currently connected to Pismo Creek or the ocean.  These waters and the southern part of Pismo Lagoon were rather turbid, owing in part to recent foot and equestrian traffic.

Pismo Lagoon was flowing to the ocean, but there was not much to collect in the cross-beach outlet channel.  We got skunked in the narrower/flowing parts, and caught 2 small tidewater goby (~15mm TL) in a wider/static pool of the outlet channel.  This outlet point was a little farther south than in recent years.  Tidewater goby seemed most abundant a short distance north of the outlet, essentially near where the outlet used to be -- we had a haul with thousands of goby in the seine (all sizes and life stages).  Among these abundant goby there were only a couple of staghorn sculpin (largest 63mm TL), and a few dozen threespine stickleback (to 44mm TL).

The lagoon depth made it difficult to seine effectively along most of the western shore, but we got a few tidewater goby in most hauls up to and including the streetside rip-rap area.  We collected a few larger staghorn sculpin (to 91mm TL), and small stickleback, in the grassy-bank areas.  One haul near the center of our surveyed area brought in a couple of unidentified tadpoles (ca. 30mm).

Perhaps most noteworthy in our last haul (southwest side of wooden bridge) was a goby measuring 56mm TL.  It appeared to be a tidewater goby -- we had not seen any other species of goby in this area previously -- but this is an unusually large specimen.  Its dorsal fins were frayed, hindering positive identification, but the front edge was still conspicuous (though more yellow than peach/clear colored).  Otherwise, this individual seemed in good condition.

Even though the lagoon was draining to the ocean, stage was higher than usual.  Our previous "landing area" at the southwest abutment of the bridge was flooded, and a green filamentous algae was getting thick.  Collectively, these conditions made a more thorough sampling of the open waters of the lagoon prohibitively difficult using our standard equipment.

Stephanie, please send me your photo(s) of the "record" goby, if any came out clearly.
Please let me know if I missed anything you recall, or if you require any additional information.
Best fishes,
Doug
