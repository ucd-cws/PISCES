	"""
	A faster version of arcpy.CreateUniqueName - given a workspace and a name, it returns a unique name

	arcpy.CreateUniqueName starts with the name you give it and iterates until it finds a name that doesn't exist.
	Unfortunately, doing this a few hundred (or thousand) times causes it to slow down the entire program just searching
	for names. Not very useful. So, this version uses arcpy still, but keeps track internally of what number we're on
	so that the search is short (or nonexistent).

	An added bonus of this version is it will return you a full path if you request it with return_full = True. The default
	behavior is just like arcpy though and returns just the new, unique name. Also, a safe_mode flag turns off the extra
	processing for debugging.

	:param name: The base name to make unique
	:param workspace: The workspace it needs to be unique within
	:param return_full: boolean. Whether or not you want the full path returned - defaults to just returning the unique name
	:param safe_mode: # turns off this function's processing and just uses arcpy.CreateUniqueName
	:return:
