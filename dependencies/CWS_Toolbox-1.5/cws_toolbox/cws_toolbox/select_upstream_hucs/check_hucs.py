"""
	This tool is meant to be used as an arcgis 10.0 (or above) script tool. It takes a layer of huc 12s and checks
	the downstream attributes using a number of unit-test like functions to ensure that they meet all criteria that
	would make them a valid data layer.

	This tool was developed in a few stages, at first just as a script to paste into ArcMap 10's Python editor, and
	secondly as a standalone script tool. As a result, it contains some vestiges of its history and a few data structures
	are somewhat of duplicates - it shouldn't be a problem, but a future version should clean these up
