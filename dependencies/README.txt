Most of this is fully superceded by the pisces installer script in the main folder

Pyodbc is required for most PISCES operations. It must be installed

Pycrypto and Paramiko are required for SFTP operations - they may not be needed for your PISCES install. If they are, install pycrypto first using the installer
then install Paramiko by navigating to the folder in a command prompt and typing "setup.py install"
