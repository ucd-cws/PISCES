Import Tools 
=============
Use the :ref:`Import Data Tool<tool-import-dataset>` in the :ref:`PISCES Toolbox<tools>` to import records to the :ref:`Observations<observations>` table. 

If the :ref:`Import Data Tool<tool-import-dataset>` is unable to import the dataset successfully, check all the configuration settings and use the :ref:`Retry Import Tool<tool-retry-import>` in the :ref:`PISCES toolbox<tools>` to try again. Double check that the :ref:`NewData table<import-config>` is configured, the :ref:`fields are mapped<import-config>`, taxa are :ref:`identified with alt_codes<alt-codes>` and the correct :ref:`input filter class<input-filters>` is able to handle the type of data to be imported.
