**PISCES**: a **Programmable** Geographic **Information** **System** for **Cataloging** and **Encoding** **Species** observations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:term:`PISCES` is a software package that consists of a python program, database, and suite of tools using ESRI ArcGIS scripting to translate species range data into an electronic record  of occurrences. The system is designed to capture, store, map and report on the spatial and temporal dynamics of species ranges using standard spatial units as primary indexing objects. The system is set up to be used for the inventory and mapping of native freshwater fish in California, but the underlying framework is agnostic to biological taxonomy or spatial extent.
